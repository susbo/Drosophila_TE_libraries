# Drosophilid transposon libraries

Semi-curated de-novo transposon libraries for 119 Drosophilid species.

## Content
A list of all species is provided in [species_list.txt](https://github.com/susbo/Drosophila_TE_libraries/tree/main/species_list.txt). The `FASTA` folder contains transposon consensus sequences for each species and the `info` folder contains the following information about each transposon:

1. Name
2. Class/Family
3. Predicted subfamily (95/80/98)
4. Predicted subfamily (90/80/90)
5. Predicted subfamily (80/80/80)
6. env ORF present
7. gag ORF present
8. pol ORF present
9. Count (buildSummary.pl)
10. Hits (blastn hits covering at least 80nt and 50% of query length)
11. Coverage (buildSummary.pl)
12. Coverage (calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl)
13. Kimura divergence (calcDivergenceFromAlign.pl)
14. Length
